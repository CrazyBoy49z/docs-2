In 1.6 we've made MoreGallery more accessible for keyboard usage. It should work intuitively by `tab`bing around, along with the following shortcuts and keyboard behaviours.

To jump the focus to specific features,use:

- `alt`+`t` to jump focus to the **t**oolbar
- `alt`+`g` to jump focus to the first image in the **g**allery
- `alt`+`b` to jump focus to the **b**ulk toolbar, only if it's visible

When focus is on an image (either from tabbing or from `alt`+`g`):

- Use `left` and `right` keys to navigate through images like you would with `tab` and `shift`+`tab`. 
- Use the `space` key when on an image to select it for [batch editing](Batch_Editing).
- Use the `down` key when on an image to go into the image actions toolbar. While there, `left` and `right` will let you jump between the actions and `space` will trigger them. Use the `up` key to place the focus on the image again. 

When modal windows are opened, it automatically focuses on the first focusable element in that modal. As the fields autosave, just `tab` out of a field to let it blur and save. Use `enter` to select a tag from the dropdown, or to create a new one based on what you typed. 

Closing modals is done with `esc` or by focusing on the `X` button and triggering with `space`. After closing the modal, focus goes back to what was last focused.
