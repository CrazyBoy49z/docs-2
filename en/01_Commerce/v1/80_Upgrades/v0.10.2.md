Commerce 0.10.2 fixes an issue in the default templates. If you have a custom `frontend/checkout/address.twig` template, you'll want to correct that as well. If you use the default theme, the update to 0.10.2 will have updated that for you.

The issue was that under the Billing Address header, it would show previously used _shipping_ addresses instead of _billing_ addresses.
 
Around line 60 in `frontend/checkout/address.twig`, change the following code:

````
{% if previously_used_shipping|length > 0 %}
<div class="c-checkout-previous-address-list">
    {% for address in previously_used_shipping %}
        {% include "frontend/checkout/partial/previous-address.twig" with {
            address: address,
            type: 'billing',
            current_address: address_billing_id
        } %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}

````

To:

```` 
{% if previously_used_billing|length > 0 %}
<div class="c-checkout-previous-address-list">
    {% for address in previously_used_billing %}
        {% include "frontend/checkout/partial/previous-address.twig" with {
            address: address,
            type: 'billing',
            current_address: address_billing_id
        } %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}
````

Note the change in placeholders in the first and third line from `previously_used_shipping` to `previously_used_billing`.
