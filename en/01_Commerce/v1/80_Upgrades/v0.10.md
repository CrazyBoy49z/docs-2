Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or status configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

**Most changes listed in this migration document are optional.**

## Status Changes

Status changes don't get updated because we can't tell if you use the default or a custom set. 

In 0.10.0-rc2, we added lexicons for the subjects, and a new email template (instead of inline content) for the email that goes to the merchant.

To edit these in your site, go to Commerce > Configuration > Statuses and click on the status change that's being used for new orders that have been paid.

Set the subject of the **Confirmation email to customer** status change action to:

```` 
{{ lex('commerce.email.order_rcvd.subject', { name: config.site_name, id: order.id }) }}
````

If you have the email content in the content field, you can also update that to the nicer email template by setting it to:

````html
{% extends "emails/order-received.twig" %}
````

For the **Confirmation Email to Merchant**, which has been renamed **Order Notification to Merchant** in 0.10.0-rc2, set the subject to:

````html
{{ lex('commerce.email.order_rcvdmerch.subject', { name: billing_address.fullname, site_name: config.site_name, id: order.id }) }}
````

And the content to:
````html
{% extends "emails/order-to-merchant.twig" %}
````

## Checkout templates
                
The `checkout/partial/summary.twig` template changed to show the shipping/billing address with autoformatted addresses. Previously these were in a hardcoded format with vcard, but now the customer country is used to determine how to show the address.

Previous:


    {% if shipping_address.id > 0 %}
        <div class="c-shipping">
            <h3>{{ lex('commerce.cart.shipping_information') }}</h3>
            <p class="c-shipping-summary">{{ lex('commerce.cart.shipping_to') }}
                <b>{{ shipping_address.fullname }} [#{{ shipping_address.id }}]</b>
                {% if shipping_method.id %}
                    {{ lex('commerce.cart.shipping_with_method') }}
                    <b>{{ shipping_method.name }}</b>
                {% endif %}
            </p>
            <p class="c-shipping-address">{{ shipping_address.address1 }}
                {% if shipping_address.address2|length > 0 %}<br>{{ shipping_address.address2 }}{% endif %}
                {% if shipping_address.address3|length > 0 %}<br>{{ shipping_address.address3 }}{% endif %}
                <br>{{ shipping_address.city }}, {{ shipping_address.zip }}
                <br>{{ shipping_address.state }} {{ shipping_address.country_formatted }}
            </p>
        </div>
    {% endif %}
    {% if billing_address.id > 0 %}
        <div class="c-billing">
            <h3>{{ lex('commerce.cart.billing_information') }}</h3>
            <p class="c-billing-summary">{{ lex('commerce.cart.billing_to') }}
                <b>{{ billing_address.fullname }} [#{{ billing_address.id }}]</b>
            </p>
            <p class="c-billing-address">{{ billing_address.address1 }}
                {% if billing_address.address2|length > 0 %}<br>{{ billing_address.address2 }}{% endif %}
                {% if billing_address.address3|length > 0 %}<br>{{ billing_address.address3 }}{% endif %}
                <br>{{ billing_address.city }}, {{ billing_address.zip }}
                <br>{{ billing_address.state }} {{ billing_address.country_formatted }}
            </p>
        </div>
    {% endif %}
    
New as of 0.10.0-rc2:

    {% if shipping_address.id > 0 %}
        <div class="c-shipping">
            <h3>{{ lex('commerce.shipping_address') }}</h3>
            {% if shipping_method.id %}
                <p class="c-shipping-summary">
                    {{ lex('commerce.cart.shipping_with_method') }}
                    <b>{{ shipping_method.name }}</b>
                </p>
            {% endif %}
            <div class="c-shipping-address">
                {{ shipping_address|format_address }}
            </div>
        </div>
    {% endif %}
    {% if billing_address.id > 0 %}
        <div class="c-billing">
            <h3>{{ lex('commerce.billing_address') }}</h3>
            <div class="c-billing-address">
                {{ billing_address|format_address }}
            </div>
        </div>
    {% endif %}
    

The `frontend/checkout/address.twig` template changed massively in 0.10.0-rc1 for the new remembered address feature. If you have a custom address.twig template from 0.9 or before, it is suggested to either copy the new one and re-do your changes, or to leave your custom template as-is, as the functionality remains backwards compatible.
