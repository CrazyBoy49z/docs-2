Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or status configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

**Most changes listed in this migration document are optional.**

## Product Images

Commerce 0.11 saw the release of primary product images. This allows you to add one image to products to show it in the cart/checkout. 

For this purpose, the default template `frontend/checkout/cart/items.twig` was slightly updated.
 
- Around line 6, a new empty header was added: `<th id="c-cart-header-image">&nbsp;</th>`
- Around line 16, the colspan wrapping the cart update button was changed from 5 to 6.
- Around line 24, the following column was added to show the image:

```` html
<td class="c-cart-item-image">
    {% if item.image %}
        <img src="{{ item.image }}" alt="{{ item.name }}" onerror="this.style.display = 'none';">
    {% endif %}
</td>
````

If you're using **Resource Products**, a new `commerce.resourceproduct.image_field` system setting allows you to connect an image TV to the Commerce products table.

If you have a **custom product type** that does not inherit the fields from comProduct, look at `core/c../c../model/commerce/comproduct.class.php` around line 299 for the field definition used in the standard commerce form.

For custom product types that fetch information from a different table/source look at `comresourceproduct.class.php` around line 118 for the new `getImage()` method you can also override in your product type. Make sure to also update your synchronise method.

## Shipping Methods (Shipments)

In v0.11 we also refactored the built-in shipping methods to base calculations on the order shipments, instead of the full order. This applies to both the pricing and availability.

This was announced in 0.8 and is now complete. While it should be backwards compatible, please verify any custom shipping methods still work as expected.

## Continuing off-site payments with POST redirect

If the client for some reason finds themselves back on the checkout while the transaction isn't confirmed/failed/cancelled yet, there was previously a redirect link to continue. This however does not work when the gateway requires a POST-style redirect (e.g. Adyen). 

To correct this, the `frontend/checkout/pending-transaction.twig` was updated in 0.11 to allow such transactions to continue as well. Around line 7, change the following:

```
{% if transaction.properties.redirectUrl %}
    <a class="c-button" href="{{ transaction.properties.redirectUrl }}">{{ lex('commerce.transaction_pending_to_gateway', { method: method.name }) }}</a>
{% endif %}
```

to:

```
{% if transaction.properties.redirectUrl %}
    <form method="POST" action="{{ current_url }}" class="commerce-pending-transaction-form commerce-pending-transaction-form-retry">
        <input type="hidden" name="retry" value="1">
        <button class="c-button" type="submit">{{ lex('commerce.transaction_pending_to_gateway', { method: method.name }) }}</button>
    </form>
{% endif %}
```

For AJAX request handling in the checkout, you'll need to make sure to look at the `response.redirectMethod` and `response.redirectData` to also support these redirects. 

## Automatically select first shipping/payment method

Small but useful tweak in `frontend/checkout/shipping-method.twig` to autoselect the first shipping method automatically if none were previously selected. 

Around line 43 change:

```
{% if shipment.method == method.id %}checked="checked"{% endif %}
```

to: 

``` 
{% if shipment.method == method.id %}
    checked="checked"
{% elseif shipment.method < 1 and loop.first %}
    checked="checked"
{% endif %}
```

Similary in `frontend/checkout/payment-method.twig` around line 14 add:

```
{% if loop.first %}checked="checked"{% endif %}
```
to the input with name `choose_payment_method`. With some new formatting applied, that should now look like:

``` 
<input  type="radio" 
        name="choose_payment_method" 
        class="c-method-radio c-payment-method-radio" 
        id="payment-method-{{ method.id }}" 
        value="{{ method.id }}" 
        {% if loop.first %}checked="checked"{% endif %}
>
```
