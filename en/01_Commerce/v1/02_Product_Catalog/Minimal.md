With a (very) minimal catalog, the products store in Commerce are the catalog. This gives you very little features in terms of providing additional information, but that's why it's called the minimal catalog. 

## Pros

- Product management is in a single place
- Best for shops with only one or very few products. 

## Cons

- (Alpha) No snippets available yet to load product information into your frontend.
- Only the basic fields (SKU, name, description, price, weight) are available per product, unless you add something else and connect the products manually.

## Setup

For the minimal product catalog, you'll create your product records in Commerce > Products as standard products. You can use a TVs to select the product or enter the product ID directly.

You can also use the [get_products](../Snippets/get_products) and [get_product](../Snippets/get_product) snippets with the minimal catalog to show product information.
