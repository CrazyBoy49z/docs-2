The Default Address module lets you define the country and state to use for tax calculations before the customer has entered their details. 

If you only sell in a specific country or state, or the vast majority of your clients come from a specific country or state, this allows Commerce to show the right tax totals right away.

An alternative method to show the right tax totals dynamically is to use the [Autofill GEO IP module](AutoFillGeoIP), which will geolocate the customer's IP address to guesstimate the country and optionally state.
