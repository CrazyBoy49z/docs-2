The [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) integration offers off-site payments with a Credit Card, or a PayPal account. Customers are redirected to PayPal to complete their payment.

See [Payment Methods](../Payment_Methods) for the basics of creating a payment method.

For PayPal, you'll need to configure:
