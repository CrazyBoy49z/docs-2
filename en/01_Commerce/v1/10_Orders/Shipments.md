Order shipments are automatically created during checkout as of Commerce v0.8. They're basically a collection of products that the customer ordered, which all belong to the same [Delivery Type](../Delivery_Types). 

Each Order Shipment is assigned to a shipping method. This makes it possible to have multiple shipping methods per order for different types of products. 

In v0.8, order shipments are not exposed in the merchant dashboard directly. This will be further expanded during the Commerce beta.
