After creating the settings and giving them a value, it's super easy to access the data. 

While the Settings are not actually stored as System Settings, you can access them in exactly the same way!

## In Chunks and Templates

In templates, chunks or other front-end parts, simply call it as such: `[[++key]]` where "key" is the key you entered for the setting in the Admin.

## In PHP

In PHP, the settings are available through the `$modx->getOption('key')` APIs. 

## ClientConfig versions before 1.4

Prior to v1.4, these values are made available through a plugin called on the OnHandleRequest event, so if you are also triggering a plugin on that event which needs the settings, make sure the ClientConfig plugin has a higher priority.

Connectors don't trigger the OnHandleRequest events, so if you want to access ClientConfig settings from a Processor before v1.4, you will need to call `$modx->invokeEvent('OnHandleRequest')` yourself - keep in mind this may have unintended side-effects from other plugins.

This was resolved in ClientConfig 1.4, where CLientConfig switched to the newer OnMODXInit event that fires for all requests.
